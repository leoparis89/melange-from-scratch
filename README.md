# Melange from scratch

![Melange from scratch](melange-from-scratch.png)

A step-by-step guide to configure a Melange project, starting from the [standard OCaml starter project](https://ocaml.org/docs/your-first-program) (`opam exec -- dune init proj hello`) and progressing through setup until you have a working React application compiled from Reason.

## Quick Start

```bash
make install  # Install dependencies
make dev      # Build and start dev server
```

Open http://localhost:8080 to see the React app!
